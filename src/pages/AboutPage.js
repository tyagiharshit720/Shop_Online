          Before Shop_Online was a platform for creating online stores, it was an online store itself. That was the original vision—when the company was created, it was never intended to be a platform for e-commerce. The site didn’t even initially plan to create its own software for the e-commerce side of things.

The first iteration of Shop_Online before it was called such was an online store that sold snowboards.
